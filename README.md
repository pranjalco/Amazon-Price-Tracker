# Project 32: Amazon Price Tracker

## Author

## Description
This project tracks the price of a specific product on Amazon. Users set a target price for the product, and the program scrapes the current price and title of the product using the BeautifulSoup library. If the current price falls below the target price, an automatic email notification is sent to the user with the subject "Amazon Price Alert." The email includes the product name, the updated lower price, and a link to the product.

> **Note**: For security purposes, sensitive information such as email addresses, app passwords, and header info have been removed. Additionally, Amazon may periodically update its URL structure, which might require adjustments to the scraping logic. Please update sensitive details and test the program with the latest Amazon URL structure before running.

## How to Use
1. Set up the following libraries in your Python environment:
   - `requests`
   - `BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`)
   - `smtplib`
   - `art`
2. Provide the Amazon product URL and set your target price in the `app.py` file.
3. Add your email credentials and SMTP configuration for notifications.
4. Run the program to track price changes.
